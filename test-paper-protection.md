# Paper Protection Test Scenarios

## 🧪 Test Cases for Paper Out Detection

### **Scenario 1: Single Print Job - Paper Out**
**Expected Behavior:**
```
🧾 Paper status: {"paperOut":true,...}
❌ Print job BLOCKED due to paper/printer issue: 🚨 CANNOT PRINT: Paper roll is empty!
```
**Result:** ❌ Print job fails immediately, no wasted printing attempt

### **Scenario 2: Multiple Print Jobs in Queue - Paper Out**
**Expected Behavior:**
```
📋 Processing print queue: 3 items
🖨️ Executing queued print job 1... (2 remaining)
🧾 Paper status: {"paperOut":true,...}
❌ Print job BLOCKED due to paper/printer issue: 🚨 CANNOT PRINT: Paper roll is empty!
🛑 Stopping queue processing due to printer issue
Print job cancelled: 🚨 CANNOT PRINT: Paper roll is empty!
Print job cancelled: 🚨 CANNOT PRINT: Paper roll is empty!
```
**Result:** ❌ First job fails, remaining jobs are cancelled (not attempted)

### **Scenario 3: Paper Low Warning**
**Expected Behavior:**
```
🧾 Paper status: {"paperNearEnd":true,"paperOut":false,...}
⚠️ Warning: Paper level is low. Consider replacing soon.
📝 Sending receipt command buffer...
✅ Data transmitted to printer
🎉 Receipt printed successfully!
```
**Result:** ⚠️ Warning logged, but printing continues

### **Scenario 4: Paper OK**
**Expected Behavior:**
```
🧾 Paper status: {"paperOk":true,"paperOut":false,...}
📝 Sending receipt command buffer...
✅ Data transmitted to printer
🎉 Receipt printed successfully!
```
**Result:** ✅ Normal printing operation

### **Scenario 5: Printer Status Check Fails (Communication Error)**
**Expected Behavior:**
```
📝 Paper status check communication failed, assuming printer OK: timeout
📝 Sending receipt command buffer...
✅ Data transmitted to printer
🎉 Receipt printed successfully!
```
**Result:** ✅ Print continues (graceful fallback for printers that don't support status)

## 🔧 Key Improvements Made

### **Before (BROKEN):**
- ❌ Paper status errors were caught and ignored
- ❌ Printing continued even when paper was out
- ❌ Queue processing didn't stop for paper issues
- ❌ Wasted printer operations and paper

### **After (FIXED):**
- ✅ Paper out detection **blocks** printing immediately
- ✅ Queue processing **stops** when paper issues detected
- ✅ Remaining jobs are **cancelled** (not attempted)
- ✅ Clear error messages distinguish paper issues from communication issues
- ✅ Graceful fallback for printers without status support

## 📊 Error Message Types

### **Blocking Errors (Stop Printing):**
- `🚨 CANNOT PRINT: Paper roll is empty! Please replace paper and try again.`
- `🔌 CANNOT PRINT: Printer is offline. Check printer connection.`

### **Warning Messages (Continue Printing):**
- `⚠️ Warning: Paper level is low. Consider replacing soon.`
- `⚠️ Warning: Printer reports an error condition.`

### **Communication Errors (Continue Printing):**
- `📝 Paper status check communication failed, assuming printer OK: [reason]`

## 🎯 Result

**Now when paper is out:**
1. **First print job** → ❌ Fails immediately with clear error
2. **Queued jobs** → ❌ Cancelled before attempting to print  
3. **No wasted operations** → 🎉 Efficient and reliable
4. **Clear feedback** → 👨‍💼 Staff knows exactly what to do
